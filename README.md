# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
By creating user stories we can insight into what the user is searching for in an application. The user stories serve as a research and develop study to see the applications that people would like to see built. 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would like to approach my programs with a clear picture of what the client wants. Once I have made sure that I understand what I am building, I would break the application down into steps so that I can develop code in chunks to promote maintainability.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe open communication is essential in being a good team member. Everyonne will have their own responsbilities and task, should you have issues and aren't able to complete your piece, you need to reach out to the team members for guidance and to keep everyone aware of their progress.
